# P2G
>P2G is source code (server-side only) of the game project developed by **No Game No Life** team of **SE1106** class. This game is group project assignment of **SWE102** course

## Technologies used
P2G using [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) and [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) to write the game server.
The server communicate with the client by [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) through web socket to make it's easier to build multi-platform game with the source will not be changed too much
## QuickStart
P2G require [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v7+ and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) v5+ to run
### Development mode
Install the dependencies and start the server.
```sh
$ cd P2G
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
### Production mode
For Ubuntu/Linux and OSX
```sh
$ cd P2G
$ npm install
$ export NODE_ENV=production
$ npm start
```
For Windows (using PowerShell)
```powershell
$ cd P2G
$ npm install
$ $env:NODE_ENV="production"
$ npm start
```
after finished the installation, go to the browser and go to the following address
```sh
localhost:3000
```
## Documentation (for client-side)
First, connect to the Socket.io server
```javascript
let io = ('/warfare')
```
